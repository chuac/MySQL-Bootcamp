To start the CLI run:	mysql-ctl cli

CREATE DATABASE <db_name>;

DROP DATABASE <db_name>;

Code won't execute until it hits a semi-colon.

USE <db_name>;

SELECT database(); // will tell you which db you're currently using.

A db is just a bunch of tables (in relational dbs).

Convention for table names is to pluralise them. Like products, cats, etc

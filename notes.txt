GOORM IDE
To start the CLI run:	mysql-ctl cli

CREATE DATABASE <db_name>;

DROP DATABASE <db_name>;

show databases;

Code won't execute until it hits a semi-colon.

USE <db_name>;

SELECT database(); // will tell you which db you're currently using.

A db is just a bunch of tables (in relational dbs).

Convention for table names is to pluralise them. Like products, cats, etc

    CREATE TABLE tablename
      (
        column_name data_type,
        column_name data_type
      );

    CREATE TABLE cats
      (
        name VARCHAR(100),
        age INT
      );

For a simple experiment, these 3 ways to show tables provides the same output:
    SHOW TABLES;
     
    SHOW COLUMNS FROM tablename;
     
    DESC tablename;


DROP TABLE <tablename>;  <-- Be careful with this!


INSERT INTO <tablename>(<column1>, <column2>)
VALUES (<column1DATA>, <column2DATA>);
^ The order matters depending on which column you first declare in the INSERT INTO line, the VALUES data has to match the order.

You can multiple insert! Declare an order of columns you want to insert these rows into with 'INSERT INTO', then have multiple data pairs after VALUEs like:
    INSERT INTO table_name 
                (column_name, column_name) 
    VALUES      (value, value), 
                (value, value), 
                (value, value);

To insert a string (VARCHAR) value that contains quotations, we can either escape the quotes with a backslash like \' or alternate single and double quotes.

When you affect a row, there could be a warning.
SHOW WARNINGS; to see what warnings there were. Strings longer than max length will get truncated to fit.

When we create a table, we can define the columns to be NOT NULL. It will not be permitted to be empty... but you should also provide a default value... otherwise
	INT will default to 0, and VARCHAR will default to empty string ''
We should chain on 'NOT NULL' AND a 'DEFAULT' when creating our table.

CREATE TABLE cats
      (
        name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'no name provided',
        age INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 99
      );


Primary Key: A unique identifier. Declare it when creating a table, can add on optional auto_increment to it! Two ways to define a column as the primary key: see below.
    CREATE TABLE unique_cats2 (
        cat_id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
        name VARCHAR(100),
        age INT,
        PRIMARY KEY (cat_id)
    );

CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    last_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    first_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    middle_name VARCHAR(100),
    age INT NOT NULL,
    current_status VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'employed'
);


the * after SELECT gives us "all the columns". SELECT <columnName> FROM <tableName>

WHERE helps us add specificity. Searching on a VARCHAR for WHERE is case-insensitive. Like WHERE breed="peRsIaN"; is fine

Aliases: rename the label for it to be printed out to us. SELECT name AS cat_names FROM cats;

UPDATE command: Good rule of thumb: Try SELECTing before you UPDATE! <--------------------
	UPDATE cats SET breed='Shorthair' WHERE breed='Tabby';
	UPDATE cats SET age=14 WHERE name='Misty';
	UPDATE shirts SET shirt_size='XS', color='off white' WHERE color='white';
		^ As you can see above, we can SET multiple columns in one command.

DELETE command: As with UPDATE, a good rule of thumb would be to try SELECTing before DELETE.
	SELECT * FROM cats WHERE name='Egg';
then	DELETE FROM cats WHERE name='Egg';
	
	Primary keys of other data entries don't shift around when you delete something.

	To delete all entries from a table (but not dropping the actual table): 
		DELETE FROM <tableName>;

Running SQL files: Firstly, make sure your SQL CLI is ran from the same directory of where your .sql file is in.
	Secondly, select the proper database you want to use.
	Thirdly, use Source to run your file: 'source query.sql' will run all the SQL code inside query.sql .

	To run an SQL file that's inside another folder (let's say the folder is called 'testing'), run 'source testing/query.sql' .
